<p> <h2>North America Liver Surgery and Neurosurgery Electrosurgical Units (ESUs) Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The increasing prevalence of liver and neurological disorders in North America is driving the demand for advanced electrosurgical units (ESUs) in liver surgery and neurosurgery. As the aging population grows and the number of individuals with chronic liver diseases, tumors, and neurological conditions rises, there is a higher need for effective surgical solutions. Technological advancements in ESU systems, such as improved energy efficiency, precision, and reduced thermal spread, are contributing to their adoption in complex surgeries. Surgeons seek high-performance tools that enhance precision and reduce surgical complications, further accelerating market growth.</p><p>Another key driver of the North American ESU market is the increasing focus on minimally invasive surgeries, which require specialized electrosurgical devices. Minimally invasive techniques for liver and brain surgeries are gaining traction due to shorter recovery times, reduced risks, and better patient outcomes. ESUs designed for these procedures are becoming more sophisticated, offering features like real-time tissue monitoring, automated power regulation, and ergonomic designs. Furthermore, ongoing research and development in the field of medical devices are resulting in the introduction of more innovative, cost-effective solutions, fostering the market's expansion across North America.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=448440&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=291" target="_blank">North AmericaLiver Surgery and Neurosurgery Electrosurgical Units (ESUs) Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaLiver Surgery and Neurosurgery Electrosurgical Units (ESUs) Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Liver Surgery and Neurosurgery Electrosurgical Units (ESUs) Market size was valued at USD 1.50 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 2.98 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 9.20% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaLiver Surgery and Neurosurgery Electrosurgical Units (ESUs) Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>Medtronic</Li><Li> Erbe Elektromedizin GmbH</Li><Li> Johnson & Johnson</Li><Li> B.
